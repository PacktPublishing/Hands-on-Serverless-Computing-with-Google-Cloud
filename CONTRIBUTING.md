## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-on-Serverless-Computing-with-Google-Cloud-Platform/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-on-Serverless-Computing-with-Google-Cloud-Platform/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [My stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification
